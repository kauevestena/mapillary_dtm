## Usage Examples

### OpenSfM Pipeline

```python
from geom.sfm_opensfm import run

# Basic usage (no refinement)
reconstruction = run(sequences, token=api_token)

# With self-calibration (full refinement)
reconstruction = run(
    sequences, 
    token=api_token,
    refine_cameras=True,
    refinement_method='full'
)

# Quick refinement (faster)
reconstruction = run(
    sequences,
    token=api_token, 
    refine_cameras=True,
    refinement_method='quick'
)
```

### COLMAP Pipeline

```python
from geom.sfm_colmap import run

# Basic usage (no refinement)
reconstruction = run(sequences, token=api_token)

# With self-calibration (full refinement)
reconstruction = run(
    sequences,
    token=api_token,
    refine_cameras=True,
    refinement_method='full'
)
```

### Dual-Track Consensus Validation

```python
from geom.sfm_opensfm import run as run_opensfm
from geom.sfm_colmap import run as run_colmap

# Track A: OpenSfM with refinement
recon_a = run_opensfm(
    sequences,
    token=api_token,
    refine_cameras=True,
    refinement_method='full'
)

# Track B: COLMAP with refinement (decorrelated)
recon_b = run_colmap(
    sequences,
    token=api_token,
    refine_cameras=True,
    refinement_method='full'
)

# Compare refined parameters for consensus
focal_a = recon_a['cameras_refined'][0]['focal']
focal_b = recon_b['cameras_refined'][0]['focal']
agreement = abs(focal_a - focal_b) / focal_a

if agreement < 0.05:  # 5% agreement
    print("✅ Consensus: Refined parameters reliable")
else:
    print("⚠️ Warning: Track A/B disagree, review data quality")
```
